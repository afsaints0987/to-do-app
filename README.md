# DISCLAIMER

There's still some bugs on the application but still manage to perform the task. Unable to fix the necessary due to time constraint

Create Frontend for a to-do application

  - multiple users to log in

  - add, update and remove to-do items

  - add, update and remove comments on to-do items

# STARTING THE APPLICATION

Before you run the application make sure to do the following

Clone the Repository on your Local Machine

<code>git clone</code> repository

After cloning the repository on your Local Machine

<code>cd</code> repository folder

Install the Dependencies

<code>npm install</code>

Run the application

<code>npm run dev</code>

I'm using a json-server to handle the database for the application

To start the server

<code>npm run server</code>

* frontend is running on http://localhost:5173
* backend is running on http://localhost:5000

Once both is running you can check the application by registering a user, you can also check the <code>db.json</code> to check users for login

# BUGS THAT HAVEN'T FIXED

1. Protected Route for Dashboard - Given it can login if you go to localhost:5173/dashboard it can still manage to go inside the component
2. Comment box simultaneously filled up
3. Existing Data is not showing upon clicking the Edit button for the Task and Comment

Thank you very much for the opportunity! and hope for the best for your company!
